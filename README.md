#### By _**Anthony Golovin, Jamila Aliyeva, Will Quanstrom & Jordan Safford**_

## Description

_The user controls a player class that jumps from platform to platform until completing the level. Different enemies attack the player who has limited health and dies once their health reaches 0. The player is equipped with an animated sword that swings on attack and is able to kill enemies in different number of hits depending on the enemies hit points. The table below informs future users of key bindings the game uses._

### Key Bindings

| Key Binding | Action | 
|---|---|
| ←  → or "a" "d"  | Move the character left and right. | 
| Space Bar | The player jumps.  | 
| Tab | Player attacks with sword.  |

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Read key bindings above._
* _Navigate to *insert URL here*_
* _Try to get to the end!_


## Known Bugs

_No known major bugs at this time. Enemies' attacks do not refresh after a certain amount of time, so if they stay in contact with the player and their collider box, they will only do one unit of damage, not damage continously._
